    "\n",
    "Apache Spark is a cluster computing platform designed to be fast and general-purpose. PySpark interfaces with the JVM to distribute the work to the cluster machines. \n",

    "Spark’s primary abstraction is a distributed collection of items called a __Resilient Distributed Dataset__ (RDD). \n",

    "> At its core, Spark is a “computational engine” that is responsible for scheduling, distributing, and monitoring applications consisting of many computational tasks across many worker machines, or a computing cluster. Because the core engine of Spark is both fast and general-purpose, it powers multiple higher-level components specialized for various workloads, such as SQL or machine learning. These components are designed to inter-operate closely, letting you combine them like libraries in a software project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At a high level, a Spark application consists of a driver program that launches various parallel operations on a cluster. The driver program contains the main function of your application which will be then distributed to the clusters members for execution. The SparkContext object is used by the driver program to access the computing cluster. For the shell applications the SparkContext is by default available through the sc variable.\n",

    "> A very important concept in Spark is RDD – resilient distributed data-set. This is an immutable collection of objects. Each RDD is split into multiple partitions, which may be computed on different nodes of the cluster. RDD can contain any type of object from Java, Scala, Python or R including user-defined classes. The RDDs can be created in two ways: by loading an external data-set or by distributing a collection of objects like list or sets.\n",
